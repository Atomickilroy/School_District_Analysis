# School District Analysis
<br>

## Overview of Project
### ***A representational analysis on a school district's funding and the corrilations to its schools student performace scores on standardized reading and math tests.*** 



<br>

## Purpose

1.  The purpose of this project was to learn the fundamentals of setting up an 
 Anaconda enviroment * to run Jupyter Notebook and import, read, create and manipulate a csv file (containing over 35,000 lines) on Pandas. In order to answer the inital question of: 
            
              'What has the most impact on a schools' student performance on standardized tests?'
<br>

<br>

2.  Additionally this project demeninstrates the impact of falsified data and how to efficiently render the data NaN utlitizing Pandas and Numpy.

<br>

 #### ***_   * Establishing this sort of enviroment allows for a discreet way of accessing and sharing senitive/ data.***
